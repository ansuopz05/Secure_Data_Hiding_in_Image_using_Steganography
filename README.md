# Secure_Data_Hiding_in_Image_using_Steganography
This project is an image-based steganography using the PIL (Pillow) and NumPy libraries. It allows users to hide a secret message inside an image by modifying the least significant bits of pixel values and later retrieve the hidden message from the modified image.
